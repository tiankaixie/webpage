**Hey, I am TK**

I am a AI researcher and developer dedicated to bridging the gap between virtual and physical realms through artificial intelligence.
With a clear vision of reducing information chaos in our increasingly digital world, I strive to develop solutions that seamlessly integrate AI into everyday life. My mission is to harness the power of artificial intelligence to enhance human experiences, making technology more accessible and meaningful while helping people navigate the complexities of our information-rich age with greater ease and purpose. Through my work, I aim to create a future where technology serves as a natural extension of human capability, ultimately improving quality of life for all.
